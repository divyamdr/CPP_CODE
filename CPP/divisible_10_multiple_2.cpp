/***There is a number X with Hitesh. At once, he can multiply X by 2. The goal is to make X divisible by 10.

find the smallest number of steps necessary to do it (it may be possible to do it in zero steps) or determine that it is impossible.

Input:

A single integer denoting the initial value of X

Output:

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer â€” the minimum required a number of turns or -1 if there is no way to win the game.
